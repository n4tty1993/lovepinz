# Agent Instructions: Custom Magnetic Pins D2C Website

This document provides a high-level overview of the project for AI agent collaboration. The goal is to build a direct-to-consumer (D2C) e-commerce platform for custom magnetic enamel pins.

The project is led by a team of three co-founders with expertise in e-commerce strategy, development, and growth. The core business objective is to create a fully automated ordering process, from design upload to production, eliminating the need for manual quotes.

## Project Vision

The platform should offer the easiest way for consumers to create and order custom magnetic pins online. Key features include a design uploader, size/finish customization, real-time pricing, instant ordering, and a digital proofing process.
