    question: "What if my artwork isn't high quality?",
    answer:
      "No worries — our design team reviews every upload. If your file needs adjustments, we'll reach out with suggestions before creating your proof. We accept PNG, JPG, SVG, AI, and PDF files. For best results, upload a vector file or an image at 300 DPI or higher.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I revise my proof?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You'll receive a free digital proof before we start production. You can request revisions until you're completely happy with the design. There's no limit on proof revisions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does production take?",
    answer:
      "Delivery takes 25 business days after you approve your digital proof. Shipping within the US is free.",

  {
    question: "What if I need changes after ordering?",
    answer:
      "If you haven't approved your proof yet, you can make changes at any time. Once production begins, we can't modify the order — but we'll always confirm with you before starting.",

  {
    question: "Do the magnets fall off?",
    answer:
      "Our pins use dual neodymium magnets that hold firmly through standard fabrics like blazers, dress shirts, and tote bags. The two-point attachment prevents spinning. They're not recommended for very thick or padded materials like heavy winter coats.",
