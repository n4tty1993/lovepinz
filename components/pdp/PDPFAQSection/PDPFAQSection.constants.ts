    question: "Can I revise my proof?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You'll receive a free digital proof before we start production. You can request revisions until you're completely happy with the design. There's no limit on proof revisions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does production take?",
    answer:
      "Delivery takes 25 business days after you approve your digital proof. Shipping within the US is free.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need changes after ordering?",
    answer:
      "If you haven't approved your proof yet, you can make changes at any time. Once production begins, we can't modify the order — but we'll always confirm with you before starting.",

  {
    question: "Do the magnets fall off?",
    answer:
      "Our pins use dual neodymium magnets that hold firmly through standard fabrics like blazers, dress shirts, and tote bags. The two-point attachment prevents spinning. They're not recommended for very thick or padded materials like heavy winter coats.",
